#### The Data
Like all data, there is much for clean up. With more time, I would eliminate all duplicate data. For example, in all states, counties would sum up to a row with all of the data, leaving some areas to be doubled. For countries, it's even worse. With more time, I would eliminate all USA issues, and spend considerable effort spot checking a lot of ROW data, hopefully eliminating all. The duplicated data is most noticeable in "Deaths by Country, Large Count" with USA having roughly 150k more deaths listed than existing. Italy is currently at 32,000 and shows just over 50,000.

#### Analysis
Looking at the death count data within the bing dataset, it's clear the generation's around will have a trauma-scar for the rest of their lives. We are looking at states such as New York and New Jersey seeing devastating cases and deaths. We are looking at huge deaths per day in the USA. It appears we reached a local peak of 10,000 deaths per dayback in April. As more and more states continue to push for large public gatherings and tightly close quartered employment, especially in the restaurant and retail sectors, this peak will not be the actual peak. States hit the hardest are California, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Countries hit the hardest are Bolivia, Colombia, India, Iran, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Russia, Sweden, and Turkey. A stark reminder that this data is only as good as it's sources, many data focused sources are claiming death counts are likely higher than reported.
